    Wait, there's even another restatement using alpha and beta coefficients in the fourier summation

    So, 4 papers and ~three conference proceedings, each using a different statement of the same technique.

    1988 American Control Conference - fifth order polynomial,
    alphas and beta coefficients on the sine terms

    1988 ASME publication presented at Winter Annual Meeting -
    third order polynomial, four boundary conditions,
    alpha and beta coefficients on the sine terms

    there's also a "multi segment" verson
