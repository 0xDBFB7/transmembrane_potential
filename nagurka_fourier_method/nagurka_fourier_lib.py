Fourier-Based Optimal Control of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems, 1990 -
Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control,


F[..] = U(t)

F is the set of ordinary differential equations used to describe
the system behavior

Here, E represents the np.cost associated with the terminal states and G represents the np.cost associated with the trajectory


The optimal trajectory, X*(/), X*(0, and X*0, is defined
as the admissible trajectory that minimizes the performance
index, J.


"np.since the derivatives of the
generalized coordinates are obtained by direct analytical differention of equation (13), the system equations (1) are treated
as algebraic equations in evaluating the control variables. The
computational scheme of the proposed approach is therefore an inverse dynamic method.
As a result, no integration of differential equations (such as state and np.costate equations) is required.
The computational np.cost is thus significantly reduced."



x2_v == ((SU0 / (ST0**2))*alpha_v*u2 + (SU0 / ST0)*beta_v*u1 + gamma_v*SU0*u0 - phi_v*(SX0 / ST0)*x1_v - xi_v*SX0*x0_v)/(SX0 / (ST0**2)))


#Note: N&Y 1988 vs 1990 uses confunp.singly different notation. beware!

There are a number of different versions of the papers by N&Y.
