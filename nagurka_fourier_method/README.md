Note: in \cite{FourierBased1990} Examples 1A and C, derived from Kirk 1970, while the $X$, $\dot X$, $\ddot X$ were all relatively close to the analytic results, the shape and integral of the control $U = X + \ddot X$ were not able to be made to correspond with the graphs and values listed in the papers, despite effort to discover the source of the inaccuracy. Because the choice of control parametrization does not alter the conclusion (moreover, it is cross-checked by a method that does not include this routine), this deviation has not yet been resolved. However, it does impair the re-usability of the code.
